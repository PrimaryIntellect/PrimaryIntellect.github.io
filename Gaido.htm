<h2>What is Gaido?</h2>
<p>Gaido, meaning guide in Japanese, is a personal assistant for students of all grades, for a busy family, for people that like utility versatility, or for someone that wants a companion. Gaido is an absolute must-have if you fall into any of these categories.
 Have a research paper that needs to be done? Tell it what your topic is and it will send you links to the most credible websites pertaining to your research needs.
 Afraid your pet won't scare away any unwanted guests? It has a camera that will send an alert to you via text and email along with a picture.  But wait, there's more!
Gaido also supports Bluetooth and can be voice activated. It will connect to your phone and to your headphones. The headphones can be used to answer the phone or Skype calls with a connection to your phone with the official app even when it's off or lost.
 It has a speaker with an always warming voice that will also tell you about reminders that set on your phone and on your phone's calendar. It can roam around your house and also comes with a flashlight to “Gaido” you in the dark.

<h2>Benefits of Gaido</h2>
<p>The benefits of having an AI-controlled robot like Gaido is incomparable.  It has everything you need and for the future of Gaido, we plan to evolve its model and add more functions as time goes on.
 It can be a friend to anyone and can be a huge time saver for doing papers or just wanting to study a certain subject.  You no longer need to rely on your phone 24/7. It may involve using the app but it is for more accessibility and even then, it's not mandatory to be on your phone.
  It's your own personal security. We, here at Primary Intellect, believe you should still get more security.
   Gaido will still get the job done to make sure you are up to date with any suspicious activity going on and immediately alert you if anything suspicious seems to happen. The app can also use Gaido as a speaker in your home.</p>
