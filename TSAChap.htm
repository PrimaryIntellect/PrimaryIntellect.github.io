<h2>About Our Chapter</h2>
<p>Under the direct advisory of East Duplin High School’s Technological Design, Robotics 1 & 2, and Technology, Engineering, and Design teacher Mr. Corey Keffer, East Duplin’s chapter of the Technology Student Association prides itself in being an avenue for students to find companionship amongst peers who share a similar passion for all things STEM related.
 Though a strong bond between members is certainly a hallmark of our chapter, it is not the full extent of what it offers.
 Creating an environment that promotes individual development in the realm of STEM, students are able to truly thrive under our chapter while obtaining the knowledge needed to not only keep in pace with a world forever advancing forward but, to lead it into the next great age of technology.

<h2>TSA Creed</h2>
<p>“I believe that Technology Education holds an important place in my life in the technical world.
 I believe there is a need for the development of good attitudes concerning work, tools, materials, experimentation, and processes of industry.
  Guided by my teachers, artisans from industry, and my own initiative, I will strive to do my best in making my school, community, state, and nation better places in which to live. I will accept the responsibilities that are mine.
  I will accept the theories that are supported by proper evidence. I will explore on my own for safer, more effective methods of working and living.
   I will strive to develop a cooperative attitude and will exercise tact and respect for other individuals. Through the work of my hands and mind, I will express my ideas to the best of my ability.
   I will make it my goal to do better each day the task before me, and to be steadfast in my belief in my God, and my fellow Americans.”
