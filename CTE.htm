<h2>Technology, Engineering, and Design</h2>
<p>Our Technology, Engineering, and Design course, taught by Emily Sandlin, is the entry-level class designed with freshmen in mind.
 It focuses on an array of concepts and activities that will enable students to think outside the box when designing and constructing anything ranging from a geodesic dome to a solid-fuel rocket.</p>
<br>
<h2>Engineering Design</h2>
<p>Engineering Design involves more of the physical implementation of many of the principles taught in the entry class, making it a bit different than its Technological Design counterpart.
 Typically, we will build small balsa wood towers among many other structures in this class.</p>
<br>
<h2>Technological Design</h2>
<p>Technological Design includes detailed instruction into the design aspect of Engineering.
 You will learn how to sketch structures by hand and on online CAD programs, two skills that will go far in aiding a student seeking a career or future in the world of engineering.</p>
<br>
<h2>Robotics I & II</h2>
<p>Robotics I & II are the last two engineering classes offered here. If you’re interested in building your own robot, this class is for you!
 Robotics I is an introduction to all of the skills required for building and programming your robot. Robotics II Honors will expand upon those skills and allow you to make and enhance your robotic friend!
</p>
<br>
<h2>Microsoft Word and PowerPoint/Access and Excel</h2>
<p>Microsoft Word and PowerPoint is the introductory class to the microsoft programs. The class consists of following set instrictions to complete a ceraton tasks. It gets the student familiarized with the program. It actaully teaches students what to do and what not to do in powerpoints.
Access and excel deals with more advance instruction like making queries and creating miniature programs that can sort things for you. It is much more number oriented.</p>
<br>
<h2>Automotive</h2>
<p>The automotive classes teaches students the basics about cars first. Generally speaking, it teaches about the safety precautions of substances, materials, tools first. Afterwards, it does more indepth about what each tool is made for and how to use them properly along with substances that may be used.
The other portion involves actually getting hands-on education to work on different vehicles. This is all done within the workshop we have here at East Duplin.</p>
<br>
<h2>Health Science</h2>
<p>Health Science is for those that want to know more about the human body and even the bodies of animals. It teaches students standard safety procedures when it comes to helping someone medically. On top of that, it will include cpr training if there is enough time.
The anatomy section teaches student abput each part in a bodily system. </p>
<br>
<h2>Agriculture </h2>
<p>Our Agricultural segment of CTE encompasses almost every part of the agriculture spectrum.
 Ranging from Animal Science to Horticulture, East Duplin's Agriculture segment of CTE excels in preparing students to be successful in careers related to Agribusiness!</p>
